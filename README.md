## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes for Developers

- **Architecture:**
  - The plugin is built using the IntelliJ Platform SDK (Java), targeting PyCharm Community Edition 2025.1+.
  - Main logic is in `src/main/java/at/wtioit/intellij/plugins/odoo/` and subpackages (`models`, `records`, `modules`, etc).
  - Uses contributors, matchers, and indexers for autocompletion, navigation, and inspections.
  - Extensible via new `CompletionContributor`, `GoToDeclarationHandler`, and `LocalInspectionTool` classes.

- **Odoo Version Support:**
  - Supports Odoo 12.0‚Äì17.0+ out of the box.
  - For new Odoo versions, check for changes in model/manifest structure and update matchers if needed.
  - No hardcoded version checks; plugin is designed to be forward-compatible.

- **Environment & Build:**
  - Requires JDK 17+ and Gradle 8+.
  - Build with `./gradlew clean build --no-build-cache --refresh-dependencies`.
  - Plugin descriptor (`plugin.xml`) is patched automatically for compatibility.
  - No `until-build` restrictions for JetBrains IDEs.

- **Testing & CI:**
  - Unit and integration tests are in `src/test/java/at/wtioit/intellij/plugins/odoo/`.
  - GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/build.yml` (build, verify, runPluginVerifier).
  - Always run tests and plugin verifier before release.

- **Publishing:**
  - Tag releases as `vX.Y.Z` and push to GitHub.
  - Distribute via GitHub Releases (preferred) or JetBrains Marketplace (optional).

- **User Support:**
  - Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
  - Keep documentation up to date in `documentation/README.md`.

- **Extending the Plugin:**
  - To add new Odoo entities or features, implement new contributors or inspections in the relevant package.
  - Follow the existing code style and architecture for consistency.
  - Update tests and documentation for any new features.

- **Maintenance Recommendations:**
  - Monitor changes in Odoo and JetBrains Platform APIs.
  - Regularly update dependencies and test with new PyCharm versions.
  - Respond to user feedback and issues on GitHub.
  - Keep the plugin open source and community-driven.
